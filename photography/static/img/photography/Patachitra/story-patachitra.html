		<hr class="divider"><br/>
		<!--<h4 class="writer">~ Written By Sudip Saha</h4>-->
		<p>
			Patachitra, an ancient folk art of Bengal is an unique combition of  painting and story telling.   The word <span class="highlight">"Pata"</span> derived from the Sanskrit word <span class="highlight">"Patta"</span> means cloth and <span class="highlight">"Chitra"</span> means paintings. The painters are called <span class="highlight">"Patuas"</span>.  Patuas do not just paint, they also sing as they unfurl the painting scroll to show it to the audience. These songs are known as Pater Gaan. The songs are of wide variety ranging from traditional mythological tales and tribal rituals to stories based on modern Indian history and contemporary issues.  Patachitra has been mentioned in Puranas, Epics, Ancient Literatures and Historical Descriptions. The style of painting is similar to the cave paintings of Mohenjodaro, Harappa and Ajanta. 'Patuas' or 'Chitrakars' have been referred to in the literary works dating back to more than 2500 years. Some researchers opine that 'Patachitra' was originally an art form of the Santhals (tribal community). With the growing influence of Buddhism, the Patuas embraced the faith. Buddhist kings and monks made extensive use of scroll paintings to preach Buddhism and during this time Patachitra probably spread to Bali, Java, Sri-Lanka, Malaysia and Tibet. With the Muslim invasions, Islam spread and the Chitrakars became followers of Islam. Traditionally the Patuas make effective use of eco-friendly colours by collecting them from leaves, fruits, flowers, plants, trees and other natural elements.  They like to use bright colours on the pata by applying bold brush strokes for sending their aesthetic appeal effectively. Not only do these inspired individuals paint their scrolls, they also compose a song for each story they illustrate. In short they are an unique tribe of folk artistes who are painters, lyricists, singers and performers rolled into one.

			My interaction with the Potuas happened when I had visited Nayagram, a remote village in West Midnapore district of West Bengal, India.  I noticed that almost every house in this village had at least one poto-artist. I also noticed that with modernization they have undergone a vast change to earn their livelihood.  They have successfully diversified their skills from making just patachitras to lending their art-form on designer dresses, decorative show-pieces etc.<br/><br/>
