		<h2 class="page-heading">Konyak - The Last Headhunters of India</span></h2> 
		<hr class="divider"><br/>
		<!--<h4 class="writer">~ Written By Sudip Saha</h4>-->
		<p>
			Nagaland, one of the <span class="highlight">"Seven Sisters"</span> of Northeast India, is a Permit Protected state bordering Myanmar. It is inhabited by 20 different Naga tribes of mixed origin having varied cultures with different physiques and appearances.
			The Konyaks are one such tribe. They had a fierce past and a unique culture which is now fast losing out to modernization. The Konyaks are considered one of the richest cultural tribe amongst all the North East Indian tribes. The tiny Longwa village situated on the eastern edge of our country is home to the Konyak Naga Tribe.<br/><br/>
			Till a few decades back, the members of this tribe would pride themselves by killing both man and animals, decapitated them and displaying them as trophies. Moreover, as an honorary mark, a young man would receive a prominent facial tattoo when he managed to take an enemy's head. Even now, one can chance on living Konyak headhunters adorned with tattoos all over his torso.
			With the exception of these behaviors, the tribal members maintain a very disciplined community life abiding all the social duties and responsibilities.
			The men who were head hunters until the late 1960's-70'S and the most feared warriors of their time are still seen even today if one visits a Konyak villages. They love the intoxicating flavor of opium and while enjoying their smoke they share stories of their glorious past. The unique feature of a Konyak member is their tattooed faces and adorning their houses with animal skulls.<br/><br/>
			I had travelled deep into the heart of Nagaland to the Longwa village in Mon district, hoping to document the last generation of headhunters. I had been planning this trip since 2015 and finally managed to visit the Konyaks in Dec 2016. On this trip I was lucky to meet several veteran warriors. As modernization has already spread its fangs, it is just a matter of time that the culture of the Konyaks would be leaving the face of the earth very soon.
			Thus it was a lifetime experience for me and I feel privileged to meet and capture their lifestyle.<br/><br/>

			<p class="story-img-text">A former Konyak headhunter who took five heads. Many headhunters wear a brass skull necklace that denotes how many heads they have hunted. According to their beliefs, by taking the head of an enemy, they would gain some of his power and soul.</p>

			<p class="story-img-text">Remote Konyak villages are still ruled by individual chieftains or "Angh" as they are known in their local dialect. Anghs are easily recognised by the band of blue beads on their legs. The width of the bead-band depicts the power and prestige enjoyed by an Angh.</p>

			<p class="story-img-text">The head-gear of the Konyak's were mainly made of hunted wild pigs horns, hornbill feathers and wild bear or goat hair.</p>

			<p class="story-img-text">A gathering of the Konyak men in a Morong (a community home) and chanting war cries. Konyaks started wearing clothes since very recently and initially used to fight naked and bare-footed.  Modernisation and influx of western culture have made the Konyaks lose their originality and thus they are now properly clothed.  Only a few elderly people still live traditionally naked.</p>

			<p class="story-img-text">Konyak women inside a typical Konyak house. They are vast, airy, with the kitchens being the most important part. A kitchen has a fireplace in the center which keeps the house warm during cold nights.</p>

			<p class="story-img-text">Bones of buffaloes, deer, boars and hornbills are still found in Konyak homes. Konyaks keep animal skulls from their hunts into their homes to protect the people living inside from the evil spirits from the jungle. The quantity and size of the skulls displayed, propionates the social status of the owner. The more and bigger the skulls, the higher the social status. It is said that there was a time when human skulls too were also displayed.</p>

			<p class="story-img-text">Only those who have successfully hunted a head would have been rewarded with the prestigious facial & Body tattoo. For every head, a warrior brings back home, he is gifted with a massive tattoo either on the face or on the chest. The bigger and greater the number of tattoos, the more the warrior is respected amongst the tribe and equally feared by the enemy.</p>
